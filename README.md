Interesting stuff:

- [Nerten's scripts](https://gist.github.com/Nerten) - I pulled the plex and aria2c installers from here

- [razrichter's calibre upstart script](https://gist.github.com/razrichter/4157867) (unmodified)

- [something with gpio](https://gist.github.com/knutmithut/502342acd38a4ea00061) - I'm not using GPIO, but it looked vaguely interesting.

- [better aria2 daemon script](https://gist.github.com/jereksel/8217470)
