Interesting stuff:

- [Nerten's scripts](https://gist.github.com/Nerten) - I pulled the plex and aria2c installers from here

- [razrichter's calibre upstart script](https://gist.github.com/razrichter/4157867) (unmodified)

- [something with gpio](https://gist.github.com/knutmithut/502342acd38a4ea00061) - I'm not using GPIO, but it looked vaguely interesting.

- [better aria2 daemon script](https://gist.github.com/jereksel/8217470)

- [info on getting plex up](https://gist.github.com/gubi/a555eb646d2f191476bf) - haven't done anything with this, plex is working fine.

- [Installing ROS](https://github.com/ethz-asl/odroid_ros/wiki)

- [Build a minimal Debian for the c1](https://github.com/tomuta/debian-mini-odroid-c1)

- [Scripts for odroid as a server](https://github.com/meveric/odroid-server) - meveric also has some other arm stuff
