- [kapolos/armhf-x2go](https://github.com/kapolos/armhf-x2go) - @kapolos has somehow managed to compile x2go-server (including the problematic nxagent) for armhf. This will allow you to run your entire X environment on your odroid and connect to it from your desktop (windows, etc) using x2go client. Like screen for X.
